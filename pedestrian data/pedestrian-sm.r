# Import Maryland State Police vehicle crash data.  Raw data is here: https://github.com/Capital-News-Service/maryland-crash-statistics, with data dictionary. These were originally stored as Excel files with multipel sheets.  We've stripped out those sheets into separate CSVs and then read in.  We're just reading in crash tables and person tables for each quarter.  Note that we're removing certain fields on read in to ensure that 2016 and 2017 fields match 2015 fields.

The second is the epsilon neighborhood (EPS), which is a proxy for density.  It says that for a point to be included, it must be within .005 (accounting for degrees lat and long) of core points of that cluster. FOR MORE: https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-037.pdf

# To check total number of people injured and killed in each cluster, we need to join our file of clusters by geo-cordinates back with master data set (which contains injury severity code).
# Note: it's CRITICAL after doing the join to manually inspect each of these files, because the fact that we're joining by geocordinates means that, in the off chance two distinct accidents have the same geocode, it will create extra records.  If there are multiople people hit in same accident (and thus same geocode), we can account for that by removing dups.  But it wont catch two accidents with same geocode.
